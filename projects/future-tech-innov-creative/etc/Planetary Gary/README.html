    <p>Important notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        due to security restrictions on local content, you must run this example
        from a web server.
      </li>
      <li>
        iOS Safari has a major bug which currently results in very poor
        performance. Apple has been made aware of this issue, and I am
        attempting to isolate it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demonstrates a variety of advanced concepts including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>preloading with progress UI &amp; multiple parallel loads</li>
      <li>using an external manifest to load sounds</li>
      <li>
        managing assets as they load
        <ul>
          <li>ex1. music plays as soon as it finishes loading</li>
          <li>
            ex2. sprite sheet builder runs as soon as all dependencies are
            loaded
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        asynchronous run-time sprite sheet generation
        <ul>
          <li>
            all art is loaded as vector which allows scaling and keeps file size
            low
            <ul>
              <li>
                to show scaling, load the game with a “scale” querystring param:
                /index.html?scale=0.3
              </li>
              <li>
                over-the-wire (gzipped) art size is only ~85kb vs ~3MB for
                sprite sheets
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>sprite sheet is generated while other assets load</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>dynamic sound effects (reverb effect when clicking Start Game)</li>
      <li>SpriteStage and SpriteContainer using WebGL for game rendering</li>
      <li>state changes</li>
      <li>DOMElement for the score board</li>
      <li>tweening music volume</li>
    </ul>

      I will likely write up more information on how different parts of this
      example works when time permits. Keep an eye on this repo, and the
      CreateJS blog for updates (blog.createjs.com).
