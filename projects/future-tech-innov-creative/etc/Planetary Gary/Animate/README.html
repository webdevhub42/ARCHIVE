      Use Flash Professional CC to open and export the PlanetaryGary_art.fla
      file as a CreateJS asset library. For Flash Professional CS6 use the Flash
      Professional Toolkit for CreateJS to export the PlanetaryGary_art_OLD.fla
      file instead.

      Note that Flash CC 13.1 has an issue with calculating bounds for frames in
      tweens. Because these bounds are used for defining the sprite sheet frame
      rects, you will notice some sprite sheet frames in the game will be
      improperly cropped if you re-export the animations. The included
      assets/PlanetaryGary_art.js file has had the frameBounds values for
      EnemyBeaver and EnemyMoose fixed to avoid this, and we are hopeful Adobe
      will release a proper fix shortly.
