        Upon arriving, the browser will prompt me to access my camera and
        microphone.
      </li>
      <li>After I give it permission, I am prompted to type in a room name.</li>
      <li>
        Once I type in the room name, a room will be created if no room of that
        name existed before.
      </li>
      <li>
        A friend of mine can subsequently go to the same website, type in the
        same room I entered, and join the same room, then enter into a video
        chat with me.
      </li>
      <li>
        If I type in a room name, and there are already two people in that room,
        I get a notification that the room is full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anyone can create or join any room. And there can be any number of
        rooms, but all of them must have unique names.
      </li>
      <li>
        I can choose to not permit the site to access my microphone and webcam.
        If I choose not to do this, or if some other driver problem occurs, I
        see an error message saying these are required.
      </li>
      <li>
        When I choose to cancel the room name input step, or if I type in no
        name, or just spaces, it should again ask me again to type in a valid
        room name.
      </li>
      <li>
        If one of the two people in the room get disconnected, they can
        reconnect to the same room and continue chatting.
      </li>
    </ol>
