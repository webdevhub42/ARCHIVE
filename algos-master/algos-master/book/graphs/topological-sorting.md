To demonstrate that computer scientists can turn just about anything
into a graph problem, letâ€™s consider the difficult problem of stirring
up a batch of pancakes. The recipe is really quite simple: 1 egg, 1 cup
of pancake mix, 1 tablespoon oil, and $$3 \over 4$$ cup of milk. To make
pancakes you must heat the griddle, mix all the ingredients together and
spoon the mix onto a hot griddle. When the pancakes start to bubble you
turn them over and let them cook until they are golden brown on the
bottom. Before you eat your pancakes you are going to want to heat up
some syrup. Here is this process as a graph:

The difficult thing about making pancakes is knowing what to do first.
As you can see above you might start by heating the griddle or by adding
any of the ingredients to the pancake mix. To help us decide the precise
order in which we should do each of the steps required to make our
pancakes we turn to a graph algorithm called the **topological sort**.

A topological sort takes a directed acyclic graph and produces a linear
ordering of all its vertices such that if the graph $$G$$ contains an
edge $$(v,w)$$ then the vertex $$v$$ comes before the vertex $$w$$ in
the ordering. Directed acyclic graphs are used in many applications to
indicate the precedence of events. Making pancakes is just one example;
other examples include software project schedules, precedence charts for
optimizing database queries, and multiplying matrices.

The topological sort is a simple but useful adaptation of a depth first
search. The algorithm for the topological sort is as follows:

1.  Perform a depth first search over the graph in order to compute the
    finish times for each of the vertices.
2.  Store the vertices in a list in decreasing order of finish time.
3.  Return the ordered list as the result of the topological sort

The diagram below shows the depth first forest constructed by conducting
a depth first search on the pancake-making graph shown above.

Finally, the diagram below shows the results of applying the topological
sort algorithm to our graph. Now all the ambiguity has been removed and
we know exactly the order in which to perform the pancake making steps.
