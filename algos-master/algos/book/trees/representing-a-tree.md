In this section, we consider some different ways to represent a tree-like shape
with data types in Python. It is important to become familiar with multiple
representations since trees occur in many contexts and the right choice of
representation in one may not quite fit another.

In Python, many of the libraries that deal with trees (such as the [html5lib](http://html5lib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) for parsing html, or [ast](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html) for working with the abstract syntax grammar of Python) use the object oriented “nodes and references” representation we discuss first. However, when building functionality around our own trees it is generally simpler to use a representation constructed from dicts and lists, which we discuss later. This simpler representation is also more portable to other languages and contexts, even those without a notion of objects (such as pen and paper!).


Nodes and references representation
---
Our first method to represent a tree uses instances of a `Node` class along
with references between node instances.

Let us consider a small example:

![ ](figures/smalltree.png)

Using nodes and references, we might think of this tree as being
structured like:

![ ](figures/treerecs.png)

We will start out with a simple class definition for the nodes and
references approach as shown below. In this case we will consider binary
trees, so will directly reference `left` and `right` nodes. For trees where
nodes may have more than two children, a `children` list could be used to
contain these references instead.

The important thing to remember about this representation is that the attributes
`left` and `right` will become references to other instances of the `Node`
class. For example, when we insert a new left child into the tree we create
another instance of `Node` and modify `self.left` in the root to reference the
new subtree.

```python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

Notice that the constructor function expects to get some kind of value to store
in the node. Just like you can store any object you like in a list, the `val`
attribute for a node can be a reference to any object. For our early examples,
we will store the name of the node as the value. Using nodes and references to
represent the tree illustrated above, we would create six instances of the Node
class.

Next let’s look at a function that can help us build the tree beyond the root
node. To add a left child to the tree, we will instantiate a new `Node` instance
and pass it as `child` to the `insert_left` function defined here:

```python
def insert_left(self, child):
    if self.left is None:
        self.left = child
    else:
        child.left = self.left
        self.left = child
```

We must consider two cases for insertion. The first case is characterized by a
node with no existing left child. When there is no left child, simply add a node
to the tree. The second case is characterized by a node with an existing left
child. In the second case, we insert a node and push the existing child down one
level in the tree.

The code for `insert_right` must consider a symmetric set of cases. There will
either be no right child, or we must insert the node between the root and an
existing right child:

```python
def insert_right(self, child):
    if self.right is None:
        self.right = child
    else:
        child.right = self.right
        self.right = child
```

Now that we have all the pieces to create and manipulate a binary tree, let’s
use them to check on the structure a bit more. Let’s make a simple tree with
node a as the root, and add nodes b and c as children. Below we create the tree
and look at the some of the values stored in `key`, `left`, and `right`. Notice
that both the left and right children of the root are themselves distinct
instances of the `Node` class. As we said in our original recursive definition
for a tree, this allows us to treat any child of a binary tree as a binary tree
itself.

```python
root = Node('a')
root.val  # => 'a'
root.left  # => None

root.insert_left(Node('b'))
root.left  # => <__main__.Node object>
root.left.val  # => 'b'

root.insert_right(Node('c'))
root.right  # => <__main__.Node object>
root.right.val  # => 'c'

root.right.val = 'hello'
root.right.val  # => 'hello'
```

List of lists representation
---

A common way to represent trees succinctly using pure data is as a list of
lists. Consider that in a list of lists, each element has one and only one
parent (up to the outermost list) so meets our expectation of a tree as a
hierarchical structure with no cycles.

In a list of lists tree, we will store the value of the each node as the first
element of the list. The second element of the list will itself be a list that
represents the left subtree. The third element of the list will be another list
that represents the right subtree. To illustrate this technique, let’s consider
a list of lists representation of our example tree:

```python
tree = [
    'a',  #root
    [
        'b',  # left subtree
        ['d', [], []],
        ['e', [], []]
    ],
    [
        'c',  # right subtree
        ['f', [], []],
        []
    ]
]
```

Notice that we can access subtrees of the list using standard list indexing. The
root of the tree is `tree[0]`, the left subtree of the root is `tree[1]`, and
the right subtree is `tree[2]`. Below we illustrate creating a simple tree using
a list. Once the tree is constructed, we can access the root and the left and
right subtrees.

```python
tree = ['a', ['b', ['d', [], []], ['e', [], []]], ['c', ['f', [], []], []]]

# the left subtree
tree[1]  # => ['b', ['d', [], []], ['e', [], []]]

# the right subtree
tree[2]  # => ['c', ['f', [], []], []]

# the root
tree[0]  # => 'a'
```

One very nice property of this list of lists approach is that the structure of a
list representing a subtree adheres to the structure defined for a tree; the
structure itself is recursive! A subtree that has a root value and two empty
lists is a leaf node. Another nice feature of the list of lists approach is that
it generalizes to a tree that has many subtrees. In the case where the tree is
more than a binary tree, another subtree is just another list.

Since this representation is simply a composite of lists, we will use functions
to manipulate the structure as a tree, analogous to the methods in our object
oriented “nodes and references” representation above.

To add a left subtree to the root of a tree, we need to insert a new list into
the second position of the root list. We must be careful. If the list already
has something in the second position, we need to keep track of it and push it
down the tree as the left child of the list we are adding. Here is a possible function for inserting a left child:

```python
def insert_left(root, child_val):
    subtree = root.pop(1)
    if len(subtree) > 1:
        root.insert(1, [child_val, subtree, []])
    else:
        root.insert(1, [child_val, [], []])
    return root
```

Notice that to insert a left child, we first obtain the (possibly empty)
list that corresponds to the current left child. We then add the new
left child, installing the old left child as the left child of the new
one. This allows us to splice a new node into the tree at any position.
The code for `insert_right` is similar to `insert_left` and is shown below:

```python
def insert_right(root, child_val):
    subtree = root.pop(2)
    if len(subtree) > 1:
        root.insert(2, [child_val, [], subtree])
    else:
        root.insert(2, [child_val, [], []])
    return root
```

To round out this set of tree-making functions, let’s write a couple of access
functions for getting and setting the root value, as well as getting the
left or right subtrees. This way we can abstract away the fact that we use the positions in a list to represent values, left subtrees and right subtrees:

```python
def get_root_val(root):
    return root[0]

def set_root_val(root, new_val):
    root[0] = new_val

def get_left_child(root):
    return root[1]

def get_right_child(root):
    return root[2]
```

We can now use our function definitions to build a tree and retrieve children of given nodes:

```python
root = [3, [], []]
insert_left(root, 4)
insert_left(root, 5)
insert_right(root, 6)
insert_right(root, 7)
left = get_left_child(root)
left  # => [5, [4, [], []], []]

set_root_val(left, 9)
root  # => [3, [9, [4, [], []], []], [7, [], [6, [], []]]]

insert_left(left, 11)
root  # => [3, [9, [11, [4, [], []], []], []], [7, [], [6, [], []]]]
get_right_child(get_right_child(root))  # => [6, [], []]
```

Map-based representation
---
Our list of list representation has a handful of benefits:

1. It is succinct;
2. We can easily construct the tree as Python list literals;
3. We can easily serialize and print the tree; and,
4. It is portable to languages and contexts without objects.

However, it has the significant disadvantage that it is somewhat difficult to
see the tree-like nature of the composite lists simply by looking at one,
particularly if it is printed on a single line.

For this reason, our preference in this book (and often in real-life
programming, for that matter) is to use a very similar representation using
nested mappings (i.e. of `dict`s in Python) such that we can name children,
values and potentially other data related to a tree node.

Using maps, our example tree may look like:

```python
{
    'val': 'A',
    'left': {
        'val': 'B',
        'left': {'val': 'D'},
        'right': {'val': 'E'}
    },
    'right': {
        'val': 'C',
        'right': {'val': 'F'}
    }
}
```

In this case, each of our nodes becomes a map with at least the `val` key, and
in some cases a `left` and/or `right` key(s).

If we were dealing with a tree that is not a binary tree, we could use a
`children` key instead:

```python
{
    'val': 'A',
    'children': [
        {
            'val': 'B',
            'children': [
                {'val': 'D'},
                {'val': 'E'},
            ]
        },
        {
            'val': 'C',
            'children': [
                {'val': 'F'},
                {'val': 'G'},
                {'val': 'H'}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This is almost as compact as our list of lists representation, and significantly
more readable, so we will continue to use this map-based representation
throughout the book.
