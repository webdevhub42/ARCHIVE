# Redux Learning Objectives: Part 2
To keep things as simple as possible when initially learning Redux, you started with using Redux independant from React. Now it's time to learn how to use Redux within a React application!

After reading and practicing how to use Redux with React, you should be able to:

* Add Redux actions, redue(s), and a store to a React project.
* Update a React class component to subscribe to a Redux store to listne for state changes
* Update a React component to dispatch aciotns to a Redux store
* Define multiple reducers to manage individual slices of state
* Use the Redux ```combineReducers``` method to combine multiple reducers into a single root deducer
* Update a reducer to delegate a state update to a subordinate reducer
* Describe how container components differe from presentational components
* Write a container component to handle all of the Redux store interaction for one or more presentational components
* Use ```Object.freeze``` to prevent the current state within a reducer from being mutated
* Create a Redux store with preloaded state.
