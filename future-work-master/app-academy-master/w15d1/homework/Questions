Would we export by just putting the export keyword infront of the class instead of exporting at the bottom?

What's with a curly brackets for the const FruitManager in the components.
const FruitManager = ({ fruit }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Available Fruit</h2>
      <FruitList fruit={fruit} />
      <h2>Fruit Inventory Manager</h2>
      <FruitSeller />
      <FruitQuickAdd />
      <FruitBulkAdd />
    </div>
  );
};
